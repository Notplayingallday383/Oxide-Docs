title: Avoiding Deployment Restrictions
---

Most free Services such as, Replit, Glitch, etc are against hosting Proxy Services. Once of the most common ways to curvumvent this is to simply Fork the repository you are trying to host and deploy. You might also want to consider static hosting but that too has its own disadvantages.

Example:

- Fork the repository under your github account. The link should look like so: https://github.com/exampleusername/examplerepo.
- Rename the repository to something else for example if your repository is named `ultraviolet-app` consider naming it to something else like `k12algebreichelp`

**NOTE** That this might not always work and your better off getting a actual vps with a domain for self hosting.
